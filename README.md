# Remote_Music_Collab
I worked on a research project titled 'MUSIC COLLAB: An IoT And ML Based Platform For Remote Music Collaboration' under Dr. Divya Lohani, Shiv Nadar University. 
This project looks into the interaction with real-time audio transmission using the tools in the domains of IoT and machine learning.
Transport layer protocols, TCP and UDP are examined for audio transmission quality. And RNN models are examined for their efficiency in predicting music and being
used as a substitute in case of loss of packets during transmission.

 The cases coded for TCP vs UDP analysis are given below:
 
• Server-client communication where the client chooses
an MP3 song stored locally in the server to be played.
This is done using TCP and UDP.
• Server-client communication where client sends an MP3
song to the server to be played on. This is done using
TCP and UDP.
• Server-multi client communication where one client
chooses and MP3 song stored locally in the server and
client machines. The song is then played on all clients
using TCP. 

The publications from this project are also provided as PDFs in this repo.

The work was published as a full paper on IEEE at the COMSNETS 2020 conference available here: https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS48256.2020.9027481

And as a student poster at the AAAI 2020 conference available here: https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i10.7214
